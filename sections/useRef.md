## `useRef`

### **[Extra]** `useRef` in general

- **Stable across re-renders**: React stores the ref to remain immutable over the course of the lifetime of the component (especially if the contents (i.e. `ref.current` value) gets mutated). Thus, `useRef` value remains the same across re-renders.
- When to use it? - You need a sort of data storage which doesn't influnce re-renders and which is tied to the component, so it's not a global variable. 
- [**CodeSandBox**: ref vs. state vs. local variable (JS)](https://codesandbox.io/s/usestate-useref-vs-local-values-ogm61?file=/src/index.js) shows the difference to an object value in `useState` and local variables.

- **Bound to a component instance**: `useRef` is bound to a component instance (as is `useState` btw). Play around with this [CodeSandBox: 07 - useRef vs. external variable (JS)](https://codesandbox.io/s/07-useref-vs-external-variable-d0zsm?file=/src/index.js) to see the difference.

### `useRef` reflects "current" value irrespective of re-renders

- Using `ref` displays current value because the ref object is guaranteed to remain stable for the lifetime of the component.
- [**CodeSandBox**: async state with timeout and ref](https://codesandbox.io/s/async-state-with-timeout-and-ref-9nu5y)
- **Task**: Change the value displayed in the alert to the **ref** value.
- You should observe that the state value "closes over" the timeout. It's frozen. But the updated ref value is accessible because it got updated 

- **React Native Question**: Why is React Native `Animated` value stored in ref?
- **Answer**: Because we want Animation value to change independent of rendering of component in which animated value gets defined.
- You donâ€™t have any guarantees that reading the refs value `countRef.current` would give you the same value in any particular callback (as opposed to state and props values). By definition, you can mutate it any time.

### **[Extra]** Other definition of `ref`

In a [tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1099842565631819776) Dan Abramov gave an interesting definition of a ref:

> `useRef()` is basically `useState({ current: initialValue })[0]`

- **Discussion**: Why does this make sense?

- **TODO**: Add CodeSandBox with this as an example.
